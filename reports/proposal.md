1) The goal of our project is visually demonstrate Brachistochrone curve using OpenGL. The lower bound is the teamâ€™s confidence to achieve the goal of being able to visually demonstrate through programming at least one cycloid example, the Brachistochrone curve, with just gravity included. After we are able to demonstrate the Brachistochrone curve, the next goal is to add on to the cycloid to visually demonstrate the tautochrone curve. Our stretch goal is to include how other factors like friction and initial velocity can affect the time to reach point b from point a in both the Brachistochrone curve and the Tautochrone curve. Another stretch goal could be to visually demonstrate other relevant curves stemming from cycloids. Another stretch goal is to visually demonstrate how cycloids and these curves pertain to real world examples such as pendulum swings, efficiency in shortest time path (the curve of fastest descent, the b curve) versus shortest distanced path, or light refraction. Another stretch goal would be to work on the GUI for the project, perhaps to make it more interactive for the user. 

2) Our team members have acquired knowledge of cycloids and curves through online readings and videos on youtube. We specifically used the youtube channel, vsauce, to witness the demonstration of the curves using a physical product. However, when Adam Savage, one of the hosts, demonstrated the t curve using the model, friction came into play which messes up the results, and only allowing the balls be tested on higher points on the curve. The other host mentioned that it would be better to demonstrate via computer simulation, which gave us the idea to do just that. 

3) For this project, the main resource we will be using is OpenGL. https://www.opengl.org/about/ We want to use OpenGL to access a high quality, high performance visual simulation to demonstrate the curve. Another main resource is creating, or testing the physics engine. We can use engines like Bullet Physics engine >insert link<. Other resources might be to use Blender to make the cycloid and to export the vertex/face mapping into OpenGL.  

4) https://trello.com/b/my1FuYhe/softsysdociledolphins  Through in class conversation on Monday 1/30 and online conversation, our team figured out the product backlog for the next two sprints based on what we have accomplished by the end of sprint 1. 

5) No roadblock questions as of now.
